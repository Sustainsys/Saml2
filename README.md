Sustainsys.Saml2
=============

The Sustainsys.Saml2 library adds SAML2P support to ASP.NET web sites, allowing the web site
to act as a SAML2 Service Provider (SP). The library was previously named Kentor.AuthServices.

Sustainsys.Saml2 is open sourced and contributions are welcome, please see 
[contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on coding standards etc.

## Branches

* v1 is a security-supported-only version that uses the `System.IdentityModel` library for token handling and supports HttpModule, Mvc, Owin and AspNetCore2 (only on full. Net Framework).
* v2 is a currently supported version that uses the `Microsoft.IdentityModel` nuget packages for token handling, multi-targets and supports HttpModule, Mvc, Owin and AspNetCore2 
* master is development for a new version (will be released as v3 eventually) that only supports Asp.Net Core.
